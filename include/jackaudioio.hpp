@class AudioIO

@brief This is an abstract class that provides a jack callback method.

This abstract class wraps the Jack Audio IO functionality needed for basic
audio input and output.  In order to create your own jack client you simply
make your own class that inherits from this class and overloads audioCallback.
In that method you can get audio in from jack and write it out to jack.
