A C++ class wrapping most of the jack client functionality, a "blocking"
interface for jack and a template class wrapping the jack ring buffer.  There
is also a swig interface generator for making scripting interfaces for the
blockingaudioio class.

Works with Linux, Will Wolcott tested with OSX.  Everything works fine except
it seems that there is a bug in the jack implementation that causes crashes
when jack_client_open (called in the constructor) starts a jack server.  It
seems that the OSX version doesn't pause the jack_client_open thread while
starting the server, so calls to jack_connect cause crashes after the server is
automatically started.  Basically, you should start a jack server before you
start your jack clients if you are OSX.
